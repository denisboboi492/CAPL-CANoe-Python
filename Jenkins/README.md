In this project we will use Jenkins to create a workflow.

#1 part: run on local Windows



#2 part: run on docker container
Short info: A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings. Containers isolate software from its environment and ensure that it works uniformly despite differences for instance between development and staging.
