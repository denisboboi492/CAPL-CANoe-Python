In this project we will use Jenkins to create a workflow.

Jenkinsfile for my pipeline can be checked [here](https://github.com/denisboboi492/CAPL-CANoe-Python/blob/main/Jenkins/WJenkinsfile).

**#2 part: run on docker container**
Short info: A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings. Containers isolate software from its environment and ensure that it works uniformly despite differences for instance between development and staging.

For Docker Container, port 8082 will be used.
